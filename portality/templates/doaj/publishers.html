<h3><a name="pubmem"></a>1) How to become a Publisher Member</h3>
<p>DOAJ is a membership organisation that relies entirely on voluntary donations from the community to develop and 
grow. We urge you to <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.support') }}">become a Publisher Member</a>.

<ul>
<li>It is a clear statement of intent about your commitment to quality, peer-reviewed open access.</li>
<li>Your contribution directly enables DOAJ to develop and improve so it consistently meets the demands of the open 
access community.</li>
<li>You may carry the DOAJ logo on your web site.</li>
</ul>

<p>Being a Publisher Member does not guarantee that your journals will be included in the DOAJ. All applications are 
treated equally from both members and non-members.</p>
<br><br>


<!-- SECTION ADVICE -->


<h3><a name="advice"></a>2) Publishing best practice and basic standards for inclusion</h3>
<p>Here are some publishing best practices. These are not ideas generated by DOAJ but are common publishing standards 
for online journals and digital posting. We have also consulted <a href="http://oaspa.org/membership/code-of-conduct/">
  OASPA's Code of Conduct</a> and we  are co-authors to the <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.bestpractice') }}">Principles of 
  Transparency and Best Practice in Scholarly Publishing</a>. Where stated, some of the items below are counted as 
  <i style="color: red">basic requirements for inclusion in DOAJ</i>.</p>

<p><b>Coverage:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Subject: all scientific and scholarly subjects are covered. We use the
<a href="http://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/lcco/">Library of Congress Classification Outline</a>.</li>
<li>Types of resource: scientific and scholarly periodicals that publish research or review papers in full text.</li>
<li>Acceptable sources: academic, government, commercial, non-profit and private sources are all acceptable.</li>
<li>Level: the primary target group should be researchers.  If the journal is run by a student body, the journal must 
have an advisory board of which at least two members have a PhD or equivalent.</li>
<li>Content: a substantive part of the journal should consist of research and/or review papers. All content 
should be available in full text on the site. See our <a href="#casereports">policy for case report journals</a>.</li>
<li>All languages are accepted.</li>
</ul>


<p><b>Access:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>The full text of ALL content must be available for free and be Open Access without delay (i.e. no embargo period).
<i style="color: red">This is a basic requirement for entry into DOAJ.</i></li>
<li>A charge may exist for a print version of the journal.</li>
<li>Registration: User registration online is acceptable on the condition that the journal has a proper Privacy Policy 
in place and abides by Data Protection rules. That is to say: user data will never be distributed without the
explicit permission of the user and, upon request, a user's email address is removed from mailing lists. All data held 
about the user will be made available to the user upon request. This policy should be stated on the web site.</li>
</ul>


<p><b>One unique URL per site. One dedicated journal site.</b><br>
<p>When a journal gets indexed it will have its own record in the Directory. To make our service comprehensible and 
user-friendly, the link to a journal from the Directory must go straight to the home page for that journal and not to 
a collection of journals or any other service. <i style="color: red">This is a basic requirement for entry into DOAJ.</i></p>

<p><a name="infopages"></a>All the necessary journal business information pages (by 'business information pages', we 
mean the journal's aims and scope, the editorial board, the author guidelines, the description of the quality control 
system, the Open Access statement, the plagiarism policy etc) must be available locally at this same URL and not be 
held centrally on another web site, or must be prominently linked to from the journal's homepage. <i style="color: red">
This is a basic requirement for entry into DOAJ.</i> This includes multi-journal publishers who may prefer to hold generic
information on a corporate website rather than locally on each journal site. Our insistence on this approach makes it easier for 
users to find and digest the specific journal information correctly. Publishers should not assume that visitors to a 
journal will automatically understand that the journal belongs to a larger group of journals or that important 
information is held elsewhere. Neither should they take it for granted that users will search for the necessary 
information that they need to carry out a full assessment of the journal. It is the publishers' responsibility to 
ensure that the information pages are easily accessible and relevant.</p>

<p>DOAJ also requests that a journal has its own dedicated, web site. No other service or product should be present 
under that URL. All the journal content that the publisher is including in the application must be in one place and 
not spread over various locations. This includes archive material. <i style="color: red">This is a basic requirement 
for entry into DOAJ.</i></p>


<p><b>One unique URL per article. One HTML entry and/or PDF per article.</b><br>
<p>Your content should be available article by article, one URL for each article, and not one URL per issue. This 
enables direct linking to the articles from DOAJ and 3rd party databases that link to DOAJ, promoting findability and 
increasing usage of your content. When article metadata is uploaded to DOAJ, every article must have a unique URL 
otherwise the upload will not work.</p>

<p><a name="issns"></a><b>ISSN number(s)</b><br>
<p>A journal must have at least one ISSN (International Standard Serial Number) registered at issn.org. <i style="color: red">This is a 
basic requirement for entry into DOAJ.</i> Applications for journals where the ISSN is not recognised or has not been 
confirmed will be automatically rejected.</p>

<p>In general, if the journal exists in print and online, it will have both an ISSN for the print version and an ISSN 
for the electronic version.</p>

<p><b>Archiving and Preservation</b><br>
<p>We strongly recommend that your content is preserved in a dedicated, digital archiving and preservation service, 
sometimes referred to as Long Term Preservation and Archiving (LTPA).
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_digital_preservation_initiatives">You can find a list some of these 
services here.</a> We prefer that journals belong to one of these services, although it is not a requirement for 
entry into DOAJ. We check all preservation statuses in <a href="http://thekeepers.org/thekeepers/keepers.asp">the 
Keepers' Registry</a>.</p>

<p><b>Organisation of content</b><br>
Please pay attention to the fact that having a clear structure when organizing your published material makes it easier 
for users to navigate between articles, for your content to be indexed in search engines and to be found online.</p>

<p>All articles must have a Publication Date. Also, DOAJ encourages the use of unique article identifiers, such as 
<a href="http://www.crossref.org/02publishers/index.html">the DOI</a>.</p>

<p>Preferably articles will be gathered in volumes and issues, with a start and end page number. Some publishers 
have moved away from this traditional volume/issue/page structure for their content. Although DOAJ does not insist on 
this structure, an issue and page number are currently required for publishers wishing to upload article metadata to 
us. Our tables of contents require a VOLUME value to associate the articles with the table of contents. Check that every 
article has a Volume value, even if the journal does not use Volume values. You may use any alpha-numeric string in this field 
but you MUST provide one. Some examples of values here are: ‘Summer’, ‘Year’, ‘0’, ‘Issue’, a year value, ‘null’, etc. 
Contact us if you require help with this.<a href="#upload">Read more about uploading metadata here</a>.</p>

<p>If publishing different types of articles (for example original articles, review articles, case studies, essays or 
book reviews), it is advantageous to display articles of the same type together in each volume and to mark each 
article with the specific article type. Articles should be arranged in to Tables of Contents and there must be a 
Browse feature to allow users to browse for articles.</p>

<p><b>Home page quality, commercials and ads</b><br>
A journal's home page should be clear, concise and easy-to-use. It must contain visible links to 
<a href="#infopages">the journal information pages</a>. It must 'demonstrate that care has been taken to ensure high 
ethical and professional standards.' (From the <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.bestpractice') }}">Principles of Transparency
and Best Practice in Scholarly Publishing</a>.) It must contain clear navigation with links to a Current Issue, the 
Archive or Past Issues, Search, Browse, the About page, the Editorial Board and Contact Us. <i style="color: red">This is a basic 
requirement for entry into DOAJ.</i></p>

<p>If the journal web site carries advertising, ensure that the ads are not in any way offensive, irrelevant and that 
they don't include information that could decrease the credibility of the journal. Blinking and/or moving objects 
will distract a reader and will make your web site difficult to use and inaccessible to users who access the Internet 
in non-traditional ways. These types of ads are strongly discouraged.</p>

<p><b>Impact Factors</b><br>
DOAJ does not believe in the value of impact factors, does not condone their use on journal web sites, does not 
recognise partial impact factors, and advocates any official, alternative measure of use, such as article level 
metrics.</p>

<p>There is only one official, universally recognised impact factor that is generated by Thomson Reuters; it is a 
proprietary measure run by a profit-making organisation. This runs against the ethics and principles of open access 
and DOAJ is impact-factor agnostic. DOAJ does not collect metadata on impact factors. Displaying fake impact factors 
on a home page is strongly discouraged and DOAJ perceives this as an attempt to lure authors in a dishonest way.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there are many fake impact factor services now purporting to offer impact factors for journals. 
These fake impact factors come at a price and an impact factor on any journal homepage should be researched carefully.
DO NOT submit papers to a journal based on its impact factor alone.</p>

<p><b>Editor(s) and editorial boards</b><br>
A journal must have an editor and an editorial board. (Only for <a href="#humanities">Humanities journals</a> will 
we accept a form of editorial review using only two editors and no editorial board.) DOAJ believes that displaying 
clear and up-to-date information about the journal's editors and editorial board increases the trustworthiness and 
credibility of the journal. A site user must be able to find and contact the editor or members of the editorial 
board if they need to. A link to the Editorial Board must be displayed prominently on the journal's home page. The 
following information must be made available on the Editorial Board page: the name, affiliation and email address 
of the editor(s); the names of the editorial board members. The page must be up-to-date. <i style="color: red">These 
are basic requirements for entry into DOAJ</i>.</p>

<p><b>Quality control and author guidelines</b><br>
It is very important to show that open access journals have the same, rigorous quality control systems in place as 
traditional printed or subscription-based journals. All articles must go through a quality control system (editorial 
or peer review) before publication and the exact type of review must be stated clearly on the web site. 
<i style="color: red">This is a basic requirement for entry into DOAJ</i>.</p>

<p>Having detailed and comprehensive guidelines for authors (Instructions for Authors) is a good way of helping 
potential contributors. A link to these guidelines must be clearly presented on the journal's homepage. 
<i style="color: red">This is a basic requirement for entry into DOAJ</i>.</p>

<p>We recommend that author guidelines include the following information:
<ul>
<li>A detailed style guide;</li>
<li>A description of the quality control processes;</li>
<li>Information about copyright (please note the importance of informing authors about whether the journal will be 
the copyright holder after publication of an article or if the copyright remains with the author(s). We strongly 
believe that authors should be informed about your copyright/licensing conditions before they submit their work);</li>
<li>the plagiarism policy;</li>
<li>description of how to submit an article;</li>
<li>a contact email address.</li>
</ul>


<p><b>Charges, Article processing charges</b><br>
Every journal must display clearly on its web site information about any charge that will be levied to an author to 
process or publish a paper. This includes article processing charges (APCs), submission charges, page charges, colour 
charges or any instance where money is required to complete the publication process. If a journal does not levy any 
charges then this too must be clearly stated. <i style="color: red">These are basic requirements for entry into DOAJ</i>.</p>

<p><b>Open Access statement</b><br>
The journal's Open Access policy must be clearly stated on the journal's web site (not the publisher's own site). It 
should also be clearly linked to from the home page. The full text of the articles of the journal should be freely 
available without embargo.<i style="color: red">These are basic requirements for entry into DOAJ</i>.</p>

<p>Here is an example of an Open Access statement, fitting our criteria, that could be published on your website:</p>
<blockquote>This is an open access journal which means that all content is freely available without charge to the 
user or his/her institution. Users are allowed to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the 
full texts of the articles, or use them for any other lawful purpose, without asking prior permission from the 
publisher or the author. This is in accordance with the BOAI definition of open access.</blockquote>

<p><a name="licensing"></a><b>2a) Copyright, Licensing, Publishing Rights</b></p>

<p><i>Licensing your material with a CC license</i>: An optimum way of showing exactly <i>how</i> a journal is Open Access is by
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/choose/">licensing the content with a Creative Commons (CC) license</a>. DOAJ considers the 
application of a CC license, or its equivalent, as best practice. Such licensing is very beneficial for authors since it shows, 
for example, if there are any limits in creating derivative works. Read more about 
<a href="https://doajournals.wordpress.com/?s=copyright">applying licenses and copyright on our blog</a>.</p>

<p>In all instances the journal web site must state clearly and precisely the terms of use and reuse that readers and authors 
have when they submit an article or use the published content, particularly if you are not using a Creative Commons license. This 
is a way of showing that you are sharing your published material to support a greater global exchange of knowledge. It is also a 
way of protecting your material from illegal use (for example if you are stating that you prohibit reproduction or commercial use 
of your articles). So, for example, your site might state that: 'users can use, reuse and build upon the material published in 
the journal but only for non-commercial purposes'. By use, reuse and build upon, we are referring specifically to the 
common definitions of open access, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access#Policies_and_mandates">given for example in
Wikipedia</a>. "Use" is downloading or reading and not much more; "re-use" is making more use of the content, for example 
distributing, making copies, using in presentations; "building upon" is a special form of re-use in which material is used to 
produce a new research work and, possibly, a new publication. Publishers may restrict the re-use of open access content (to 
Non-Commercial or to Share Alike as described in the corresponding Creative Commons license attributes: NC and SA) and may even 
prohibit building upon content by not allowing Derivatives (the altering, transformation, or building upon content, as described 
in the corresponding Creative Commons license attributes: ND) to be made. <b><i>Publishers who restrict the re-use of content in 
line with any of the Creative Commons licenses are all still eligible for indexing in DOAJ</i></b>. However, DOAJ has a strong 
preference for the use of Creative Commons licenses, especially the least restrictive: the Creative Commons CC-BY license 
(Attribution). Under the terms of a CC BY license "you must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate
if changes were made". "You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or 
your use" (from <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)</a>.</p>

<p>If you are NOT using a Creative Commons license, you must fill in your application form specifying what other usage terms 
apply (e.g contract, publishing agreement, publisher-specific license) and these terms must be similar to the terms of the 
Creative Commons licenses that are listed in order to be accepted into DOAJ. When writing their own license we strongly advise
publishers to get legal advice before adopting a standard text or constructing their own. You must make sure that you use the 
correct legal language. (The information provided here does not constitute legal advice.)</p>

<p>Please note that "Fair Use" is different to Open Access and is interpreted differently in the United States, Europe and 
in various other countries in the world. Fair use often means allowing limited use for educational purposes without having to 
ask for permission. Fair use applies irrespective of Open Access and open access licensing conditions. A journal offering only 
Fair use will always be rejected.</p>

<p>Please take care to identify any possible contradictions between your Open Access policy and your copyright 
policy, or any incompatibilities between your copyright policy and Creative Commons licensing. 
<a href="https://doajournals.wordpress.com/category/copyright-and-licensing/">Read more about this on our blog.</a></p>

<p>If licensing old material, please make sure that your journal has the copyright permission of the published 
material. If you do not, you have to ask the original copyright holder for permission before licensing the articles.
(More information can be found in the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Before_Licensing">Creative Commons 
wiki</a>.)</p>


<p><b>Plagiarism</b><br>
It is recommended that publishers make use of one of the several plagiarism detection services that are available.
Plagiarism is a big problem and plagiarised articles on a web site are often an indicator of a poor quality 
journal, or a journal that uses no quality control system. You should publish a plagiarism statement on your 
site, as well as the piece of software that you use to detect plagiarism.</p>
<br><br>


<!-- SECTION APPLYING -->

<h3><a name="applying"></a>3) Applying for your journal to be in DOAJ</h3>
<p>For a journal to be included in DOAJ, it must go through the application process. <a href="/application/new">The application
form</a> is very detailed and it will take time to complete. You are advised to collect all the necessary information, 
such as URLs, up front before you start filling in the form. You cannot save your progress in the form so you 
must submit the application in one session.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT NOTE<br>
If the application form contains information that is inaccurate or clearly wrong, or if answers have been missed or skipped, then it will 
be automatically rejected. To give an example of one of the most commonly encountered errors: sometimes applications are submitted where 
every question that asks for a URL contains the same answer over and over, just pointing to the same page, the homepage. Our editorial 
teams will not spend time reviewing these applications and they will be automatically rejected.</p>

<p><a name="spreadsheet"></a><b>Before you start</b><br>
<ol>
<li>Make sure that you have <a href="#advice">read the section above</a> and that your web site fulfills those 
items marked in italics as basic requirements for entry into DOAJ.</li>
<li>Read <a href="#advice">our disclaimer</a> and make sure you fully understand its implications.</li>
<li>Make sure that you have read and fully understand <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.bestpractice') }}">
  Principles of Transparency and Best Practice in Scholarly Publishing</a>. Does your journal comply?</li>
<li>Make sure you have downloaded and read through the <a href="http://bit.ly/1MLszb4">'application form as 
a spreadsheet'</a> document as this will help you complete the application. Use this spreadsheet as a place to collect the information.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Filling in the application form</b><br>
<p>You must submit an application online. Do not send spreadsheets.</p>
<p>The information that you provide in <a href="/application/new">the application</a> must match what is displayed on your web site. Double 
check that the information you are submitting matches.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT NOTE<br>
If the application form contains information that is inaccurate or clearly wrong, or if answers have been missed or skipped, then it will 
be automatically rejected. To give an example of one of the most commonly encountered errors: sometimes applications are submitted where 
every question that asks for a URL contains the same answer over and over, just pointing to the same page, the homepage. Our editorial 
teams will not spend time reviewing these applications and they will be automatically rejected.</p>

<p>The country that you enter in the application form must be the country of the publisher, where the publisher 
carries out the majority of the editorial processes, business functions and day-to-day activities. The country of an 
address registered via a registering agent (typically: the United States) is not allowed.</p>

<p><a href="http://andreamarchitelli.it/actual/tag/doaj/">Alcune risorse sono disponibili anche in italiano | 
Some further resources are available in Italian</a>. (These posts have been created by one of our Associate Editors, Andrea 
Marchitelli.)</p>

<p><b>Once you submit your application</b><br>
<p>Upon submission you will be shown a confirmation screen and you will be sent a confirmation email. Save this 
email as it will help us find your application later, should you have any questions about it.</p>

<p>Each journal application will be assessed by up to four different members of the DOAJ Team:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Triage</b>. Duplicate applications will be automatically rejected. Applications that have no ISSN(s) or 
fake ISSN(s), or that contain ISSN(s) not registered at www.issn.org will be automatically rejected. Titles that differ from
what is registered at issn.org will be changed to match issn.org. Applications 
that have been submitted instead of REAPPLICATIONS will be automatically rejected. We will not notify you if your 
application has been rejected for any of these reasons. It is YOUR responsibility to make sure that issn.org hold the most
current and up-to.date version of your information.</li>
<li><b>Managing Editor</b>: will review the application and assign it to an Editor Group. Post review, the Managing
Editor will make the final decision on whether to accept or reject your application. A Managing Editor may decide 
to reject an application without further review, especially if the application that you have submitted is incomplete.
You will be notified.</li>
<li><b>Editor</b>: will assign the application to an Associate Editor. Post review, the Editor will double check the
Associate Editor's recommendations.</li>
<li><b>Associate Editor</b>: will carry out the review of your application and will email you to ask questions, if
necessary. The Associate Editor will make a 'reject' or 'accept' recommendation.</li>
</ol>
<p>DO NOT submit your application more than once. Duplicate applications are automatically rejected without 
notification.</p>

<p><b>Waiting for a decision</b><br>
<p>You will receive an automated email when your application is assigned to a member of the editorial team. You will receive a 
second automated email when that person starts working on it. Every application is reviewed manually and it takes time to ensure that we do this carefully and thoroughly. We carry out this
process as quickly as possible but also to a very high standard. Currently, due to the extra workload incurred by the 
reapplication project and by the sheer number of applications we are receiving, it is taking up to 6 months to make a decision on 
an application or reapplication. We apologise in advance for the extended wait but please be assured that we are working as hard 
as we can with the resources that we have. We ask you to refrain for requesting status updates for applications that are under
6 months' old.</p>

<p><b>Reasons for rejection</b><br>
<p>One of the most common reasons for rejecting an application is that we receive no response from the applicant to 
our emails. We will automatically reject the application after 1 month. Please be sure to check your Spam folder 
frequently and be aware that the Associate Editor who is reviewing your application is a volunteer and will not be 
emailing you from a doaj.org email address.</p>

<p>Common reasons for rejection are:</p>
<ul>
<li>no response from the applicant</li>
<li>incomplete or incorrect ISSN information</li>
<li>incomplete application</li>
<li>every URL in the application form is identical</li>
<li>duplicate application</li>
<li>journal does not adhere to the Principles of Transparency and Best Practice in Scholarly Publishing</li>
<li>journal does not fulfil the basic requirements listed on this page</li>
<li>journal is not open access</li>
<li>journal does not publish original research</li>
</ul>
<br><br>


<!-- SECTION ACCEPTED -->

<h3><a name="accepted"></a>4) If your application is accepted</h3>
<p>Upon acceptance in to DOAJ, the journal is classified by subject and assigned an LCC code by the DOAJ team. An 
automatic confirmation email is sent to the Journal Contact (this may be different to the Applicant). A second 
email is sent that contains details on how to log in to your Publisher account. You will need these details to 
upload article metadata. The journal is then visible in DOAJ immediately. If you do not get your email, check your 
Spam folder before contacting us.</p>
<br><br>

<!-- SECTION REJECTED -->

<h3><a name="rejected"></a>5) If your application is rejected</h3>
<p>If your application is rejected, a member of the DOAJ team will let you know, along with the reason(s) for the 
rejection. A rejected journal may reapply for inclusion, usually after 6 months, once it has demonstrated clearly 
that it has made the improvements suggested by the DOAJ. Applications submitted before 6 months will be automatically
rejected.</p>
<br><br>

<!-- SECTION DISCLAIMER -->

<h3><a name="disclaimer"></a>6) Disclaimer</h3>
<p>The applicant is responsible for providing accurate information when submitting an application for consideration.
If the information provided is not sufficient or is incomplete, the application will not be considered. In cases 
where information provided is found to be untrue, either during reviewing or even after admission, we reserve the
right to reject or remove the journal with immediate effect and to not accept new applications for a period of 1 
year. In cases where a single publisher has submitted more than 5 applications with false information, we reserve 
the right to remove all of the publisher's journals listed in DOAJ and to not accept any more applications for a 
maximum period of 3 years, depending on the number of journals for which false information was provided and the 
eventual number of repeated incidents.</p>
<br><br>

<!-- SECTION UPLOADING XML -->

<h3><a name="upload"></a>7) How to get your journal content / article metadata indexed in DOAJ. Uploading content.</h3>
<p>It is the publisher's responsibility to upload article metadata to DOAJ. DOAJ does not actively collect article
metadata for journals it indexes.</p>

<p>You must log in to <a href="{{ url_for('publisher.index') }}">your Publisher Area</a> before you can begin to
upload metadata to us. You may only upload metadata for those journals in your account. You should ensure that 
your journal record is up-to-date in DOAJ before you upload metadata to us. Discrepancies in the ISSN information 
will cause the upload to fail. If you need to update a journal record please contact us: feedback[at]doaj[.]org.</p>

<p>Every article you upload to DOAJ must have a unique URL. If you use the same URL for all articles, the upload will
fail. Each article uploaded will overwrite the last so you will end up with only the last article online.</p>

<p>There are three ways to get your metadata in to DOAJ.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Manually enter the metadata, article by article</b>, using the 'Enter Article Metadata' tab. This method is 
ideal for uploading the occasional article or for correcting an existing article. It will suit journals that do not publish 
many articles per month.<br>
Metadata uploaded this way is checked for errors and then published to the site immediately. 
You may only enter plain text. DO NOT enter HTML formatting, tables, images, style sheet (CSS) coding from Microsoft Word, or 
any other form of code. Anything other than plain text may cause an error and, at the very least, prevent your
articles from being found in searches.<br>
To correct existing articles, the full text URL must remain the same otherwise the new version will not overwrite the 
old version.</li>

<li><b>Upload DOAJ XML to us</b> via the 'Upload Article XML' tab. You can either upload the file manually by 
selecting it from a location on your computer OR you can enter the URL where the DOAJ site should go to look for the 
file. The location can be http or ftp.<br>
Before you upload the file to us, <a href="http://www.freeformatter.com/xml-formatter.html">format it</a> and 
<a href="http://www.freeformatter.com/xml-validator-xsd.html">validate it</a>. 
(<a href="https://doaj.org/static/doaj/doajArticles.xsd">The xsd file for DOAJ is here</a>.) These two steps identify most 
upload problems.<br>
You will see a message 'File successfully uploaded - it will be processed shortly'. Processing takes place every 30 minutes.
All XML files are checked for errors and, if a problem is found, an error message will be displayed, 'processing failed', in the
'History of uploads' section. If the upload has been successful, you will see a 'Successfully processed' message in the 
'History of uploads' section. Articles are processed every half hour so come back to your account after 30 minutes. As soon as 
the XML has processed successfully, the articles are published to the site. The Table of Contents for a journal updates 
overnight.</li>

<li><b><i>Coming later this year!</i></b> Use the DOAJ  publisher API for publishers and others who are authorised to 
submit applications automatically or modify article metadata directly. 
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/doaj-api-announcements">Sign up to the announcement group</a> or 
follow us on <a href="#news">our news channels</a> to find out more about our full API offering, and release dates.</li>

<!-- SECTION FAILED UPLOADS -->

<h3><a name="failed"></a>8) Failed XML uploads</h3>
<p>Below are some common reasons for failed xml uploads:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>You are trying to upload XML to the wrong account.</b> You can only upload XML for the journals that appear in
the list under 'Your Journals' in the publisher area. If you have more than one account and you would like to merge
them, please contact us and we will inform you of the process for merging accounts.</li>
<li><b>You are trying to upload a file that is not XML.</b> We can only accept XML. Do not try to upload PDFs to us as
these will be rejected.</li>
<li><b>The ISSN information in the metadata that you are trying to upload does not match what is in the journal 
record on DOAJ.</b> For an upload to be successful, the ISSN(s) provided in the metadata must match precisely the 
ISSN(s) that we
hold on record. A journal may have two ISSNs: an ISSN for the print version and an ISSN for the electronic version.
Sometimes the DOAJ record only holds one ISSN on file and needs to be updated, or the ISSNs of the journal have changed.
Similarly, if the DOAJ record has two ISSNs listed but only one is presented in the XML, a fail will occur. If you
need to have the ISSNs of your DOAJ record updated, please <a href="/contact">contact us</a> and we will check that the
ISSNs are registered at www.issn.org and will then update the record accordingly.</li>
<li><b>The XML is missing a required tag.</b> Sometimes a publisher will try to upload XML to DOAJ that is missing a
specific tag, such as [publicationDate]. You can see exactly
<a href="{{ url_for('doaj.features', _anchor='xml_upload') }}">which tags are required here</a>. If you are having
difficulty with your XML file, there are plenty of resources online where you can check the validity of your XML file.
We are unable to provide specific XML advice. If you are trying to upload a file that was automatically generated by the
OJS DOAJ plugin, then you should first contact OJS for help.</li>
<li><b>The XML is not formatted to the correct .xsd file.</b> 
<a href="https://doaj.org/static/doaj/doajArticles.xsd">The xsd file for DOAJ is here</a>. All XML files uploaded to 
DOAJ must reference this xsd file and validate against it.</li>
<li><b>The XML file contains characters not recognised in the XML language.</b> Sometimes, special characters, especially
those in scientific articles are submitted in the wrong format. XML does not support many special characters but those
that it does can be
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_XML_and_HTML_character_entity_references#Predefined_entities_in_XML">found
on Wikipedia</a>.</li>

<!-- SECTION TROUBLESHOOTING XML -->

<h3><a name="trouble"></a>9) Troubleshooting XML uploads</h3>
<p>DOAJ is not staffed to help with XML queries. We have put together this list of resources and possible solutions 
that we have collected over the years. It is your responsibility to provide us with correctly formatted XML. HTML 
coding is NOT accepted: we only display plain text.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you can't see the article on the Table of Contents (ToC) for your journal, it doesn't necessarily mean that the 
article did not upload successfully to DOAJ. It may be that you didn't provide an VOLUME value so the article failed
to attach itself to the ToC correctly. Do a <a href="http://bit.ly/1RyJ4Ot">search on the full article title</a> to see if it 
upload to DOAJ. If you do find the article, you will need to re-upload it with a volume value in place.</li>
<li>If only the last article that you uploaded is appearing on the site (both in search and on the ToC), then it is 
likely that you have not provided a unique full text URL for every article. Every article's full text URL MUST be
 unique.</li>
<li>Make sure that the ISSN details in the file you are trying to upload match exactly what we hold for the journal on DOAJ.
Discrepancies may cause the upload to fail.</li>
<li>Make sure your XML file is formatted correctly. There is 
<a href="{{ url_for('doaj.features', _anchor='xml_upload') }}">a sample file here</a> and 
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0fPCpIPjZlmSmRlZW9IcHdwUGc/view?usp=sharing">a more detailed example here</a>.
You can also check the validity of your file using <a href="http://www.freeformatter.com/xml-validator-xsd.html">an online 
XML validator</a> and the format of your file using <a href="http://www.freeformatter.com/xml-formatter.html">an online 
XML file formatter</a>. Some browsers, such as Internet Explorer 11, have very good built-in XML display plugins that will 
also allow you to make sure that the file is structured properly.</li>
<li>Make sure that you have no HTML codes in your XML. XML files can only contain XML coding.</li>
<li>If you received a message that the file you tried to upload to DOAJ is not valid XML, this maybe because you have
included non-XML codes in the file. If you are using OJS to host your journal and you export the DOAJ XML via the 
plugin, note the details of this particular problem:<br>
There are some fields (e.g. abstract) where it is possible to include HTML code in OJS. OJS uses a third party plugin,
TinyMCE, as an HTML editor for those fields. If you paste text from Microsoft Word into the abstract field, the plugin
also copies HTML and style sheet coding from the Word document into the abstract field. (You can check if this is
happening by opening the field in the HTML view on OJS and you will see the additional code.)<br>
XML can only contain plain text and XML coding. We recommend that when you are creating your articles in OJS, you do NOT copy 
directly from Word. Instead, copy the abstract content into a plain text editor, such as Notepad, WordPad or TextPad, first. You
can also use <a href="http://www.freeformatter.com/xml-formatter.html">an XML formatter</a> to strip out this code before you upload
the XML to DOAJ.</li>
<li>If you get repeated messages that your file has failed, try to upload a handful of articles manually using the manual 
entry method. If this works successfully, then you know for certain that there is something problematic with your file
rather than the upload process itself.</li>
<li>We have created <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0fPCpIPjZlmSmRlZW9IcHdwUGc/view?usp=sharing">a very basic 
template XML file with notes</a> for you. Open it with a plain text editor. It explains how the file is formatted and 
shows you how each record in the file should be structured. Next to each field is a note telling you whether the field 
is compulsory or not.</li>
</ol>

<br><br>


<!-- SECTION CORRECTING METADATA -->

<h3><a name="correct"></a>10) How do I correct an error in article metadata?</h3>
<p>If you need to correct an error, you must upload the metadata again. To make sure that your new upload overwrites
the old one, at least one of two specific pieces of metadata in the new file must be the same as in the old file.
The 2 specific pieces of metadata that we look for are, in priority order:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>DOI</b> - if you assign DOIs to your articles then we will match on the DOI.</li>
<li><b>Full Text URL</b> - this is the URL that you give us for the full text of the article.</li>
</ol>
<p>If there is no DOI, the script will look for the Full Text URL.</p>
<p><b>Some examples</b></p>
<p>Use case 1: a publisher wants to correct some article metadata because an author is missing. The publisher must
re-upload the file. The article's DOI in the XML is the same as on the site so the site automatically overwrites the
older version.<br>
Use case 2: a publisher wants to correct the URL for their full text articles because their site has moved.
The publisher does not use DOIs. The publisher must upload a new version. No automatic overwriting
will happen because no matching can occur so the publisher must contact us so we can remove the older version.<br>
Use case 3: one article in an issue contains a spelling mistake in one of the author names. The publisher can correct 
the entry manually, without contacting DOAJ, by logging into their account and clicking on the 'Enter Article Metadata'
tab. Enter the new, correct metadata into the form and submit. Since the URL of the article is not changing, the
correction will overwrite the old version.</p>
<br><br>


<!-- SECTION COMPLAINT -->

<h3><a name="complaint"></a>11) How to make a complaint or appeal</h3>
<p>If you would like to make a complaint, or would like to appeal against the decision to reject your application you
should send email to Dominic Mitchell, Community Manager, (dom[@]doaj[.]org) that contains the following information:
</p>

<p>
- journal title<br>
- journal ISSN<br>
- reason for complaint or appeal
</p>

<p>For an appeal, you should attach a copy of the original rejection email that you received. Individual cases will 
be discussed every two weeks at a team meeting where the entire DOAJ Team are present. After the meeting, and within 
3 weeks of you sending an email to Dominic, a Managing Editor will email you with the result of your appeal. This will
not be the same Managing Editor who handled your case originally.</p>

<p>For a complaint, your case will be discussed at a meeting between the Managing Director, Editor-in-Chief and the 
Community Manager. They may consult the Advisory Board. Within 3 weeks of your email to Dominic, the Managing Director
will inform you whether or not your complaint has been upheld.</p>
<br><br>

<!-- SECTION NO SEAL -->

<h3><a name="noseal"></a>12) Does no Seal mean we are not indexed in DOAJ?</h3>

<p>No. Being awarded the Seal is completely separate to being accepted into DOAJ. Only journals that are indexed in DOAJ can be 
considered for the Seal. The Seal is an extra mark of approval that is awarded to journals in DOAJ.

<h3><b><a name="journal"></a>Why can't I find my journal in DOAJ?</b></h3>
<p>It maybe that your journal has not applied to be in the DOAJ, in which case, please 
<a href="{{ url_for('doaj.suggestion') }}">submit an Application</a>. It may be that the journal's application is 
still pending or that the journal has been removed. If you believe that your journal has been wrongly removed then 
please contact us.</p>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

<br><br>

<h3><b><a name="solong"></a>Why does DOAJ take so long?</b></h3>
<p>Every application is reviewed manually and by at leat 3 people. It takes time to ensure that we do this carefully and 
thoroughly. We carry out this process as quickly as possible but also to a very high standard. Currently, due to the extra 
workload incurred by the reapplication project and by the sheer number of applications we are receiving, it is taking up to 6 
months to make a decision on an application or reapplication. We apologise in advance for the extended wait but please be assured that we are working as hard 
as we can with the resources that we have. We ask you to refrain for requesting status updates for applications that are under
6 months' old.</p>

<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

<br><br>

<h3><b><a name="uploadmetadata"></a>How do I upload article metadata?</b></h3>
<p>Once a journal has been accepted in to DOAJ, article metadata may be uploaded as XML or created manually. If 
the journal belongs to an existing DOAJ account, then you must log in to the existing account and then add metadata 
via the Publisher Area. For more information read <a href="#upload">'Uploading Metadata'</a>.</p>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

<br><br>

<h3><b><a name="nometadata"></a>I have uploaded article metadata to DOAJ but it has not appeared on the site. Has 
something gone wrong?</b></h3>
<p>If you did not receive any error messages when you uploaded the metadata then it is likely that everything has 
worked OK. Remember that it may take up to 60 minutes for your articles to appear on the site and up to 12 hours 
for the tables of contents to show your latest uploads. You can check that the articles have uploaded correctly by 
doing a search on the full article title in inverted commas " ". If, after 12 hours, you see that the article is on 
the site but has not attached itself to the Table of Contents then it likely that you did not provide a volume value. 
Our tables of contents require a volume value to associate the articles with the table of contents. Check that each
article has the correct value for both Volume and Issue. If your journal does not use Volume values you may use any
alpha-numeric string in this field but you MUST provide one. Some examples of values here are: ‘Summer’, ‘Year’, ‘0’,
‘Issue’, a year value, ‘null’, etc. Contact us if you require help with this.</p>

<p>If, after 24 hours, you still cannot find your article on the site, please Contact us.</p>

<h3><b><a name="definition"></a>How do we define 'Open Access Journal', 'Quality Control', 'Research Journal' and
'Periodical'?</b></h3>
<p><b>Open Access Journal:</b><br>
We define open access journals as journals that use a funding model that does not charge readers or their institutions
for access. From the BOAI definition<sup>[1]</sup> of open access we take the right of users to <b>'read, 
download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of these articles...or use them for any other 
lawful purpose"</b> as mandatory for a journal to be included in the directory.<br>
[1] <a href="http://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/read">http://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/read</a>
</p>

<p><b>Quality Control:</b><br>
<p>The journal must exercise peer-review or editorial review (particularly in the Humanities), led by an editor, or
an editor and an editorial board.</p>
<p><b>Research Journal:</b><br>
<p>Journals that report primary results of research or overviews of research results to a scholarly community.</p>
<p><b>Periodical:</b><br>
<p>A serial appearing or intended to appear indefinitely at regular intervals, generally more frequently than 
annually,
each issue of which is numbered or dated consecutively and normally contains separate articles, stories, or other
writings.</p>

<h3><b><a name="seal"></a>What is the DOAJ Seal of Approval for Open Access Journals (the DOAJ Seal)?</b></h3>
<p>The DOAJ Seal is a mark of certification for open access journals, awarded by DOAJ to journals that achieve a 
high level of openness, adhere to Best Practice and high publishing standards. To receive the Seal, the journal 
must comply with the following 7 conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>use DOIs as permanent identifiers;</li>
<li>provides DOAJ with article metadata;</li>
<li>deposits content with a long term digital preservation or archiving program;</li>
<li>embeds machine-readable CC licensing information in articles;</li>
<li>allows generous reuse and mixing of content, in accordance with a CC BY, CC BY-SA or CC BY-NC license;</li>
<li>has a deposit policy registered with a deposit policy registry;</li>
<li>allows the author to hold the copyright without restrictions.</li>

<h3><b><a name="thetick"></a>What does the green tick symbol next to some journals mean?</b></h3>
<p>The green tick ("The Tick") is displayed against all journals that were accepted in to DOAJ after March 2014 
when DOAJ launched its new criteria for journals to be accepted in to DOAJ. The new criteria require a higher level
of compliance to best practices and publishing standards. Journals that do not have The Tick are in the process of 
reapplying under the new criteria.</p>

<h3><b><a name="continuation"></a>My journal has changed title and ISSN. What should I do?</b></h3>
<p>When a journal changes title and get a new ISSN, this is called a 'continuation'.</p>
<p>If your journal has changed title then it must have a new ISSN. If you do not have a new ISSN then contact your local ISSN 
office. The ISSN must be confirmed and registered at issn.org before you can go further with us.</p>
<p>Once you have the new ISSN then you must submit <a href="/application/new">a new application to us</a> with all of the details
of the new journal, including the new title and new ISSN. After you have submitted the application, send an email to us at 
feedback[at]doaj[.]org and let us know that you have just submitted an application for a continuation. Include the OLD ISSN
and title, and the NEW ISSN and title in your email. We will then join the two in the Directory for you.</p>

<h3><b><a name="progress"></a>How do I save my progress when filling out the application form?</b></h3>
<p>It isn't possible to save your Application just yet; it's a feature that we will add in the
future. In the meantime, you could try these two tips to help you keep a record of your application(s):</p>
<ul>
<li>Before you start, print out a version of the form to use as a draft. The form prints best in Google Chrome.</li>
<li>The application form requires a lot of information. Before you start filling it in,
we recommend that you collect up front all the information you will require. We have created
<a href="http://bit.ly/1MLszb4">a
spreadsheet version of the form for you to download and complete offline</a>. For your convenience there are columns
for more than one journal but you MUST complete ONE online application per journal.</li>
<li>If you haven't used the spreadsheet to collect your application's information, you can record your answers by
taking screenshots of the completed form BEFORE you hit the Submit button.</li>

<h3><b><a name="casereports"></a>Do case reports count as original articles?</b></h3>
<p>When applying for a journal to be included in DOAJ, you should include case reports in your article count if they
include the retrospective analysis of more than 3 clinical cases. When more than three cases are involved, the
article constitutes "research."</p>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

<br><br>

<h3><b><a name="humanities"></a>Do you accept journals that carry out editorial review only (instead of peer review)?</b></h3> 
<p>DOAJ recognises that some journals may not publish in a field where peer review is the established form of quality
assurance. Instead a system of editorial review—carried out by the editors or the editors and members of the editorial
board only—is in place. This is particularly relevant to the Humanities. 'Editorial review' will only be accepted as 
an answer to <a href="/application/new#review_process-container">Question 35 of the Application Form</a> if the 
journal publishes in some such field. We do not accept journals that only have one editor with no editorial board.</p>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

<br><br>

<h3><b><a name="deposit"></a>We have no deposit restrictions on articles published in our journal. Why does the
Application Form ask for information about deposit policies?</b></h3>
<p>Funders, libraries and authors can all access deposit policy directories to get an overview of publishing
channels that are compliant with, for instance, funder policies. This is one of our areas where we are encouraging
Best Practice. A good example of a deposit policy directory is
<a href="http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/">www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/</a>.</p>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

<h3><b><a name="getlicense"></a>How do I get a Creative Commons license on to my content?</b></h3>
<p>(You may have an equivalent license in your country that is not a CC license. This is perfectly valid for DOAJ.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose the most appropriate CC license from the Creative Commons web site—refer to the paragraph below.</li>
<li>We recommend that you apply the CC BY license which is the most user friendly allowing for, among other things,
self-archiving and text- and data-mining.</li>
<li>If you have different licenses for different articles within the same journal, you may only display the most
restrictive alongside your journal in DOAJ.</li>
</ul>
<p>How to choose the CC BY license:</p>
<p>Go to the Creative Commons (CC) web site <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/">
(http://creativecommons.org/licenses/)</a> and copy the CC BY icon - you can also consult this:
<a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Before_Licensing">http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Before_Licensing .</a>
</p>
<p>Put the CC BY icon on the homepage of your journal(s) and on EVERY article.
<a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Marking_your_work_with_a_CC_license">Read how</a>. Best Practice recommends
that the
license metadata is machine readable that is to say: embedded in the HTML, XML or in the PDF metadata.</p>

<h3><b><a name="embedded"></a>How do I know if my license information is embedded in the metadata?</b></h3>
<p>When applying for a journal to be included in DOAJ, one of the questions asks whether or not you have
machine-readable licensing information embedded in your article metadata. There are
<a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Ccrel">guidelines on the Creative Commons</a> web site that tell you
more about
this. The information must be embedded in the HTML, the XML or the PDFs. Sometimes, it will be embedded in individual
article components too, such as an MP3, an image or a video. The emphasis for DOAJ is not HOW the license is embedded
but that there IS a <b>machine-readable</b> version of it. Here are a couple of examples:
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.globalhealthaction.net/index.php/gha/article/view/23456">Displayed in the HTML on an article
abstract page</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0097648">
Displayed at the bottom of the abstract, as part of the abstract</a></li>
